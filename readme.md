#Knapsak Web App
A visual packing app for young kids

### The Problem

"We are going to grandma and grandpa's. Pack up!"

I find that many times as a mom, I am not only packing for myself but I end up packing for the kids as well. There are many packing list apps out there but what if your kid is too small to read? They can still pack for a trip with a visual packing list!

### Features

- User able to save multiple knapsaks for different trips
- "Pack" your bags visually through counters
- Generates a printed list for you kids to check-off
- Kids learn responsibility by packing for themselves
