## The Problem
"We are going to grandma and grandpa's. Pack up!"

I find that many times as a mom, I am not only packing for myself but I end up packing for the kids as well. There are many packing list apps out there but what if your kid is too small to read? They can still pack for a trip with a visual packing list!

Kids learn to be responsible by packing for themselves and adults are happy because it is 1 less thing off your list.

What if you can save different "Knapsacks" for different trips? A knapsak for the weekend away trip or a knapsak for the snowboarding week in the mountains or a knapsak for visiting grandparents during the holidays.

Generates a printed list for your kids to check-off.

Pack up and let's go!
